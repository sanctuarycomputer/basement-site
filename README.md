# Basement - Documentation Site

This is the Jekyll site that powers https://basement.sanctuary.computer/.

## Local Development

Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sanctuarycomputer/basement-site.git
```

Install dependencies to you local environment:

```bash
# npm packages
yarn

# ruby gems
bundle install
```
