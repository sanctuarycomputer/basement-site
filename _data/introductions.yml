Basement is unopinionated — there are no colors, margins, Cards or Buttons defined here. It is written entirely in Sass, so all settings can be overwritten by simply defining variables in a .scss file.'

In practice, not all grids are 12 columns, breakpoints are constantly changing, and not all designers adhere to a rigid scale of margin and padding. We also stripped away any opinions regarding typography and decoration and left that up to the user to define.'
